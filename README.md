# rustLearning

A repo for me to share my completed rust exercise with my friends

---
## Get Started

```
git clone https://github.com/SakthivelDurai47/rustLearning.git
```

- Clone this repository and start going through my exercises
- Each exercises have 2 versions, one is a compiled binary version, which can be directly run without needing rust compiler
- Another is the source file, which can be used to read the actual program, make changes and run your version of the program
---
## How to run the program

### On linux
- To simply run the binary files
```
cd bin/<exe_name>

chmod +x <exe_name>

./<exe_name>
```

- To read / make changes to the source file
```
cd source_file/<exe_name>

//you will need cargo for this, visit the official rust page on how to install rust

cargo build

cargo run
```

## On Windows
- Same steps for the linux applies but the binary files cannot be executed, you will need to compile your own .exe file using cargo inside the soruce_file

```
cd source_file/<exe_name>

//you will need cargo for this, visit the official rust page on how to install rust

cargo build

cargo run
```
- Now run the compiled .exe file
